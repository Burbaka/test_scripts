Description
-----------
This set of scripts prepares test data for CMM application tests. 
They generate specific junk files for different clean up modules.

- Cache Files
- User Log Files
- Broken Preferences
- Broken Login Items

To generate data for each of those modules you could execute specific 
script located in `junk_data_scripts` folder. 


####### Broken Login Items
This script generates files in system Library directory. Thus you need
execute it under 'root' permissions (user) from the Terminal.
This is how you could [run it from PyCharm](https://esmithy.net/2015/05/05/rundebug-as-root-in-pycharm/)

####### Generations of all test data
In the root directory there is a simple script that calls all module separate scripts.
It allows to generate test data for everything within one script execution.
Because of launching the Login Items it also should be executed under the 
`root` permissions.

Requirements (environment setup)
------------
Executions was tested only on MacOS.
This project is [Python](https://www.python.org/) based, so you will need Python to work with it.

```
brew install python3
```

How to run
----------
###### From the Terminal

For example, you could execute
```
python3 user_log_files.py
``` 
(`python3` is a reference to Python 3.7+ that is added to your PATH)

###### From the IDEA

Configure Project Interpreter to use virtual environment. To do that 
In Terminal from the main project folder do the following
`python3 -m virtualenv venv`

You could execute each script as separate file by right click on it and
launching the _Run_ command.
